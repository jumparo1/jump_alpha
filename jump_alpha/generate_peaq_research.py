    'quick_overview': '''Moat üõ°Ô∏è: Layer-1 for machines (DePIN), optimized for identity, AI, and multi-chain interoperability. Unique data verification & economic model for devices.

Users üë§: IoT builders, DePIN protocols, AI infra startups. Solves ownership, identity, and monetization for connected devices.

Token üí∞: $PEAQ | Launched on Polkadot parachain | CIRC ~488M | FDV ~$325M | Unlocks ongoing (check Tokenomist)

Forkability üåÄ: Built with Substrate; forking infra is possible but identity + economic layer is deeply integrated.

Users/Nodes üìà: 20+ DePIN apps | Real-world deployments in mobility, energy, telecom

Social üì£: Twitter/X: Strong dev-to-retail narrative. Vibrant $PEAQ community, lots of DePIN meme traction.

Team üß†: Founded by @LeonDahms, @TillmannMartinetz | Backed by Outlier Ventures, Borderless Capital

Bullish üü¢: First-mover in DePIN-specific L1 infra, growing ecosystem, strong VC support, real-world usage.

Bearish üî¥: High FDV, competing with modular chains (Cosmos, Avail), unclear moat vs generalist L1s.

VC / Whales üê≥: Raised ~$15M+ | Borderless, Outlier, Fundamental Labs | No large whale dumps detected''',
